# Global Economic Insights

This project is an in-depth analysis of global economic data, leveraging datasets from sources like the World Bank and United Nations. By exploring key indicators such as GDP, population growth, and the Human Development Index (HDI), this project provides a data-driven look at economic performance and quality of life worldwide. Our aim is to identify trends, disparities, and progress across regions, supporting insights for sustainable development.

## Project Overview

- **Highlight Economic Trends**: Understand how different countries and regions are performing economically.
- **Uncover Disparities**: Identify significant differences in economic growth, development, and living standards.
- **Support Policy Making**: Provide insights to help inform decision-making and sustainable development policies.

## Key Data Sources
- **World Bank**: Economic and development indicators from multiple countries.
- **United Nations**: Data on HDI and other key socio-economic metrics.
